## Deployment

This application can be deployed using two different methods which are described in the following sections.

In all cases, the application will not immediately start without errors because it needs to be configured first.
This is done via environment variables.
See [Configuration](#configuration) for the list of available options.

### On Docker

A docker image is built automatically that follows the master branch of the repository.
It is available as `ghcr.io/fsinfuhh/vinywaji:dev-latest`.

Simply start it via

```shell
docker run --name vinywaji ghcr.io/fsinfuhh/vinywaji:latest
```

Configuration can be specified by supplying environment variables during `docker run` with the `-e` argument.
I.e. `docker run -e VW_SECRET_KEY=foobar123 â€¦`.

### On Baremetal from source

*Although this deployment works, it is not recommended. If you need to use a deployment without containers, you should
serve this application via uwsgi, gunicorn or the like.*

To build the application from source, follow the following steps:

```shell
# get the code
git clone https://github.com/fsinfuhh/vinywaji.git
cd vinywaji

# install locked python dependencies
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
```

To start it:

```shell
pipenv shell
./src/manage.py check --deploy
./src/manage.py migrate
./src/manage.py tailwind build
./src/manage.py runserver
```

## Development

Install dev dependencies:
```shell
pipenv shell
pipenv install -d --ignore-pipfile
```

Install npm. E.g.:
```shell
sudo apt install nodejs npm
```

Run Django Dev Server
```shell
./src/manage.py check --deploy
./src/manage.py migrate
./src/manage.py runserver
```

Run tailwind server
```shell
./src/manage.py tailwind start
```

## Configuration

The application is configured at runtime via the following environment variables:
