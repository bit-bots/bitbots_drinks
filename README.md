## Deployment

This application can be deployed using two different methods which are described in the following sections.

In all cases, the application will not immediately start without errors because it needs to be configured first.
This is done via environment variables.
See [Configuration](#configuration) for the list of available options.

### On Docker

A docker image is built automatically that follows the master branch of the repository.
It is available as `$TODO`.

Simply start it via
```shell
docker run --name bitbots_drinks $TODO
```

### On Baremetal from source

*Although this deployment works, it is not recommended. If you need to use a deployment without containers, you should serve this application via uwsgi, gunicorn or the like.*

To build the application from source, follow the following steps:
```shell
# get the code
git clone $TODO
cd $TODO

# install locked python dependencies
pipenv install --ignore-pipfile
```

To start it:
```shell
cd src
./manage.py check --deploy
./manage.py migrate
./manage.py
```

## Configuration

The application is configured at runtime via the following environment variables:

| Name | Default | Description | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|-------|
| BL_DB_PATH | *required* | Path to the database file. | In container based deployments this preconfigured to point to `/app/data/db.sqlite` |
| BL_SECRET_KEY | *required* | Django secret key. | It can be generated by calling `manage.py gen_secret_key`. In container based deployments this is done automatically. |
| BL_ALLOWED_HOSTS | *required* | List of hostnames which may be used when accessing the application. ||
| BL_SERVED_OVER_HTTPS | `false` | Whether the application is served over HTTPS. If enabled, automatic redirects and additional security measures are activated. ||
| BL_HSTS_SECONDS | `63072000` | If larger than 0 and `BL_SERVED_OVER_HTTPS` is true, HSTS is enabled with this configured value. ||
| BL_TRUST_REVERSE_PROXY | `false` | If true, headers set by a reverse proxy (i.e. `X-Forwarded-Proto`) are trusted. | Defaults to `true` for Kubernetes deployments. |
